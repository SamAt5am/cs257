        A cryptic crossword puzzle is a variation on the classic crossword, but with extra tricky clues!
    </p>

    <p>
        While the standard New York Times-style crossword is more popular in the US, cryptic crosswords are more popular overseas. In a cryptic crossword, clues take on a very particular structure:
    </p>

    <p>
        One part of the clue is a literal definition of the intended answer. The other part is a super elaborate pun meant to hint at the answer. Consider the following clue, which appeared in a 2019 puzzle from the New York Times Magazine:
    </p>

    <p>
        "Not up to par, truant soldier retreats into drink (5,7)"
    </p>

    <p>
        The answer is BELOWAVERAGE. "Not up to par" is a literal clue for BELOWAVERAGE. However, the rest of the clue is far more devious. A truant soldier can be described as "AWOL", and "drink" is another word for "beverage." If we insert the acronym AWOL backwards into the word BEVERAGE, we get BELOWAVERAGE, so a truant soldier is "retreating into drink."

        Fun!
